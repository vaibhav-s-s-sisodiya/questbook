# Questbook

## Introduction

Questbook is a fresh take on traditional to-do lists, task managers, and project planners. It aims to be a fully functional and engaging tool, incorporating fun and innovative features. As the project evolves, new ideas and improvements will be added.

## Aim

As I start Questbook, my main aim is to learn and improve my skills and to make something genially good and usefully after it.

## Features

Here are some ideas and features I plan to implement in Questbook:

- **Quests, Endeavors, and Sagas:** Instead of conventional to-dos or tasks, users will manage Quests, Endeavors, and Sagas.
- **XP and Level System:** A rpg approach with XP and leveling up to motivate users to complete their tasks.
- **Enhanced CSS:** Visually appealing design with animations and custom SVGs to enhance the user experience.
